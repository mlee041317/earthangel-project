            There have been many times when I have seen a beautiful soul and I have immediately begun to note all of the ways in which I don't resemble them, the soft look of their face, the smooth glow of their skin, the perfect shape of their nose, and the fullness of their lips. In these moments it seems to make sense to deduce that I cannot be beautiful too, but that's not logical, nor fruitful, and it's certainly not truthful. A sunflower looks nothing like a rose, but what a gift it is that they both exist, and seeing a sunset is unlike the view from a cliff side, but I swear time stops within both of these moments. It is clear that there are countless of ways to be breathtaking and exquisite, my eyes are well adjusted to a very small percentage but I will choose a wider view one that includes both cliff side and sunsets because why would I wish for a life that only recognizes the beauty of one of them? There is room within this term, the Universe will remind me again and again. Our bodies, our minds, our spirits, our lives need not to be subjected to comparison.
